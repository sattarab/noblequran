          <strong>The Quran</strong>, also romanized <strong>Qur&apos;an</strong> or <strong>Koran</strong> is the central religious text of Islam revealed to <strong>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H)</strong> by God through the archangel Gabriel. It is regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. It is organized in 114 chapters (surahs), which consist of verses (ayat).

        <AboutPageSectionBody>
          The Meccan surahs are the chronologically earlier chapters of the <strong>Quran</strong>. The Meccan surahs are believed to have been revealed anytime before the migration of <strong>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H)</strong> and his followers from Mecca to Medina (Hijra). Meccan surahs are typically shorter than Medinan surahs, with relatively short verses (훮y훮t), and mostly come near the end of the Qur&apos;an.

        <AboutPageSectionBody>
          The Medinan surahs are chapters of the <strong>Quran</strong> which were revealed after the migration of <strong>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H)</strong> and his followers from Mecca to Medina (Hijra). Medinan surahs typically have relatively longer verses (훮y훮t), and mostly come either at the start or the middle of the Qur&apos;an.
